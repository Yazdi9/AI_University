    "\n",
    "[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is an open source machine learning and deep learning framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What can PyTorch be used for?\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch allows you to manipulate and process data and write machine learning algorithms using Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Who uses PyTorch?\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the worlds largest technology companies such as [Meta (Facebook)](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/pytorch-builds-the-future-of-ai-and-machine-learning-at-facebook/), Tesla and Microsoft as well as artificial intelligence research companies such as [OpenAI use PyTorch](https://openai.com/blog/openai-pytorch/) to power research and bring machine learning to their products.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "For example, Andrej Karpathy (head of AI at Tesla) has given several talks ([PyTorch DevCon 2019](https://youtu.be/oBklltKXtDE), [Tesla AI Day 2021](https://youtu.be/j0z4FweCy4M?t=2904)) about how Tesla use PyTorch to power their self-driving computer vision models.\n",

    "Tensors are the fundamental building block of machine learning.\n",

    "Their job is to represent data in a numerical way.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you could represent an image as a tensor with shape `[3, 224, 224]` which would mean `[colour_channels, height, width]`, as in the image has `3` colour channels (red, green, blue), a height of `224` pixels and a width of `224` pixels.\n",

    "> **Note:** Different datatypes can be confusing to begin with. But think of it like this, the lower the number (e.g. 32, 16, 8), the less precise a computer stores the value. And with a lower amount of storage, this generally results in faster computation and a smaller overall model. Mobile-based neural networks often operate with 8-bit integers, smaller and faster to run but less accurate than their float32 counterparts. For more on this, I'd read up about [precision in computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_(computer_science)).\n",

    "| [`torch.reshape(input, shape)`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.reshape.html#torch.reshape) | Reshapes `input` to `shape` (if compatible), can also use `torch.Tensor.reshape()`. |\n",
    "| [`Tensor.view(shape)`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.Tensor.view.html) | Returns a view of the original tensor in a different `shape` but shares the same data as the original tensor. |\n",
    "| [`torch.stack(tensors, dim=0)`](https://pytorch.org/docs/1.9.1/generated/torch.stack.html) | Concatenates a sequence of `tensors` along a new dimension (`dim`), all `tensors` must be same size. |\n",
    "| [`torch.squeeze(input)`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.squeeze.html) | Squeezes `input` to remove all the dimenions with value `1`. |\n",
